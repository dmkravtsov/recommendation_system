# Blogger Clustering Project with LDA Model

## Overview
This project explores the thematic structure of documents and employs clustering methods to identify bloggers who are active and efficient in their work. It uses two datasets: one describing the general characteristics of 107 bloggers and the other including data about their publications.

## Objective
The goal is to apply clustering methods to select bloggers for further publication based on their activity and efficiency.

## Datasets
- **General Characteristics**: Contains information on 107 bloggers.
- **Publications**: Includes detailed data about the bloggers' posts.

## Workflow
1. **Importing Libraries**: Necessary libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and modeling are imported.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Text data is cleaned and prepared for analysis.
3. **Feature Engineering**: New features are added, and datasets are combined for comprehensive analysis.
4. **Clustering Analysis**: Clustering methods are applied to group bloggers based on similar characteristics.
5. **Text Analysis with LDA**: The Latent Dirichlet Allocation model is used to explore the thematic structure of bloggers' documents.
6. **Visualization**: Various plots are created to visualize the data and the results of the analysis.

## Results
The project concludes with an interpretation of the clustering results and the thematic analysis provided by the LDA model. Recommendations are made based on the client's objectives and the insights gathered from the data.

## How to Use
- Prepare your environment by ensuring all necessary libraries and dependencies are installed.
- Load your datasets and follow the established workflow to preprocess data, perform clustering, and analyze text.
- Interpret the results using the provided visualizations and outputs to draw conclusions and make informed decisions.

## Recommendation Algorithm for Business Advertising

The project further evolves to implement a recommendation algorithm based on comparing the thematic texts of authors and the activity sectors of companies. The recommendations are based on the cosine similarity between vectors describing the industry and the thematic texts of authors.

### Objective

Develop a recommendation algorithm that helps businesses identify suitable bloggers for advertising by matching the thematic relevance of their publications to the company's industry.

### Methodology

1. **Vectorization of Text**: Vectorize the text data of both bloggers and companies using TF-IDF to transform textual information into a numeric form that can be compared.
2. **Cosine Similarity Calculation**: Compute the cosine similarity between each author's vector and the industry vectors of different companies.
3. **Identification of Top Matches**: Sort and identify top bloggers whose thematic texts are closely related to the company's industry based on the cosine similarity scores.

### Implementation

- Import necessary libraries for data manipulation, text preprocessing, and vectorization.
- Prepare and clean the text data for both bloggers and companies, ensuring a consistent format for analysis.
- Utilize the TfidfVectorizer from the scikit-learn library to vectorize the texts.
- Calculate the cosine similarity between the bloggers' texts and companies' industry descriptions.
- Sort and identify the top bloggers for each company based on similarity scores.

### Results

The algorithm provides a ranked list of bloggers for each company based on the thematic relevance of their publications to the company's industry. Companies can use this list to make informed decisions about which bloggers might be the most suitable for advertising their products or services.

### Usage

- Ensure all necessary libraries and dependencies are installed.
- Load the datasets containing bloggers' publications and companies' industries.
- Run the scripts to preprocess, vectorize, and calculate the similarity.
- Review the recommendations and make decisions based on the similarity scores.

## Future Enhancements

- **Threshold for Selection**: Establish a minimum similarity score threshold to filter out the most relevant bloggers.
- **Personalization**: Incorporate additional factors such as blogger's reach, engagement rate, and audience demographics for a more personalized recommendation.
- **Continuous Learning**: Update the algorithm periodically with new data to capture the evolving interests and themes of both bloggers and companies.
