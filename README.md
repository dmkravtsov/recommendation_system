# Blogger Clustering Project with LDA Model

## Overview
This project explores the thematic structure of documents and employs clustering methods to identify bloggers who are active and efficient in their work. It uses two datasets: one describing the general characteristics of 107 bloggers and the other including data about their publications.

## Objective
The goal is to apply clustering methods to select bloggers for further publication based on their activity and efficiency.

## Datasets
- **General Characteristics**: Contains information on 107 bloggers.
- **Publications**: Includes detailed data about the bloggers' posts.

## Workflow
1. **Importing Libraries**: Necessary libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and modeling are imported.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Text data is cleaned and prepared for analysis.
3. **Feature Engineering**: New features are added, and datasets are combined for comprehensive analysis.
4. **Clustering Analysis**: Clustering methods are applied to group bloggers based on similar characteristics.
5. **Text Analysis with LDA**: The Latent Dirichlet Allocation model is used to explore the thematic structure of bloggers' documents.
6. **Visualization**: Various plots are created to visualize the data and the results of the analysis.

## Results
The project concludes with an interpretation of the clustering results and the thematic analysis provided by the LDA model. Recommendations are made based on the client's objectives and the insights gathered from the data.

## How to Use
- Prepare your environment by ensuring all necessary libraries and dependencies are installed.
- Load your datasets and follow the established workflow to preprocess data, perform clustering, and analyze text.
- Interpret the results using the provided visualizations and outputs to draw conclusions and make informed decisions.
